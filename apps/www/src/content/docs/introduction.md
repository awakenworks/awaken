description: "Awaken — Rust agent runtime where the framework is itself the platform. Tools-first, live-tuned prompts, built-in tracing/eval/HITL."
---

**Awaken** is a production AI agent runtime written in Rust. The framework is the platform: when the server is up, tracing, replay, eval, permission gating, and an admin console are already running.

Three design rules drive everything else:

## 1 — Tools live in code, prompts live in config

Code defines tools (typed schemas, state writes, deferred loading). Spec/config holds agent system prompts, tool descriptions, reminders, skill catalogs, permission rules.

Editing config takes effect on the **next run**. No restart, no redeploy, no schema migration. MCP servers refresh automatically via the `tools/list_changed` notification; on-disk skill packages refresh via a `PeriodicRefresher` you start once at bootstrap. The runtime re-resolves from the latest published config snapshot on each new run.

## 2 — One config API, one admin console

`/v1/config/*` is the single source for agents, models, providers, plugins, MCP servers, skill packages, permissions, and trace history. The bundled admin console is one consumer; your CI can be another.

What the console writes, the runtime reads. There is no separate ops project to maintain.

## 3 — Observability/eval/HITL come with the server

Started services automatically expose:

- OpenTelemetry GenAI traces on every phase, tool, and LLM call (`awaken-ext-observability`).
- A persistent trace store the admin console queries directly.
- An eval framework with fixture replay, scoring, and baseline diffing (`awaken-eval`).
- Permission-gated HITL via mailbox suspend/resume.

These are not opt-in libraries. They are the runtime.

## Four capabilities that follow

The above three rules combine to give four properties most agent frameworks lack:

- **Snapshot isolation + deterministic replay.** Each phase reads an immutable `Snapshot`, emits a `MutationBatch`; `commit` applies atomically. Saved snapshots replay byte-for-byte — debug, regression-test, or re-run eval over past traffic without re-paying LLM cost.
- **One backend, multiple protocol adapters.** One runtime serves AI SDK v6, AG-UI (CopilotKit), A2A, MCP HTTP, and ACP stdio from one process. Client protocol choice does not propagate to agent code.
- **Permission gates as runtime primitives.** `Gate` phase runs between tool decision and tool execution; `Allow` / `Deny` / `Ask` rules match on name + arguments; `Ask` suspends through mailbox and resumes when answered.
- **Generative UI as streamed primitive.** Agents emit A2UI / JSON Render / OpenUI Lang documents on the same event stream as text. Frontend renders without per-tool glue.
