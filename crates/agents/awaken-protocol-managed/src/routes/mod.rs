//! The routing concern: the axum routers and handlers for every Managed Agents
//! surface. Handlers only decode DTOs (from `types`), call the backing state, and
//! encode responses — no runtime or protocol logic.
//!
//! One submodule per surface. Each management-plane resource submodule bundles its
//! router with the in-memory store it drives (its backing state is a routing
//! detail, not shared vocabulary):
//! - [`sessions`] — the core session/events/threads/resources surface, plus the
//!   shared HTTP plumbing ([`ManagedJson`], [`error_response`]) the others reuse.
//! - [`agents_registry`], [`deployments`], [`environments`], [`user_profiles`],
//!   [`vaults`] — the management-plane resource CRUD surfaces.
